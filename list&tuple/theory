📋 LIST in Python
A list is a collection of items (numbers, words, etc.) that is ordered, changeable (mutable), and allows duplicate values.
Lists are written with square brackets [].

✅ Topics Covered in List:
List Creation

A list is created using square brackets: mark = [95, 45, 34, ...]

Length of List

len(list) tells how many items are in the list.

Indexing in List

You can access items using their index: list[0] gives the first item.

🛠️ List Methods
append()

Adds an item to the end of the list.

Example: list.append(32)

sort()

Arranges the list in ascending order.

Use sort(reverse=True) for descending order.

reverse()

Reverses the order of elements in the list.

insert(index, element)

Adds an element at a specific position.

remove(element)

Removes the first occurrence of the element from the list.

pop(index)

Removes the element at a specific index.

🔁 TUPLE in Python
A tuple is like a list, but it is immutable (you cannot change it after creating it).
Tuples are written with parentheses ().

✅ Topics Covered in Tuple:
Tuple Creation

Example: a = (1, 2, 3)

type()

Tells the data type of the object.

Example: type(a) → returns <class 'tuple'>

index()

Finds the position of the first occurrence of a value.

count()

Tells how many times a value appears in the tuple.
