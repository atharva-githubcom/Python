ðŸ”¹ Variables
Variables are containers used to store data like numbers, text, etc.

Example: a = 5, name = "Atharva"

ðŸ”¹ Data Types
Python has different data types:

int â†’ integers (e.g., 5)

float â†’ decimal numbers (e.g., 4.5)

str â†’ strings (e.g., "hello")

ðŸ”¹ Operators
Arithmetic Operators:

+, -, *, /, % (modulus), ** (power)

Used for mathematical operations.

Comparison Operators:

==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Used to compare values (returns True or False).

Assignment Operator:

= assigns a value.

+=, -=, etc., are shorthand to modify and assign values.

ðŸ”¹ Type Casting
Converting one data type to another (e.g., int("10") â†’ converts string "10" to integer 10).

ðŸ”¹ Input/Output
input() is used to take user input (always as a string by default).

print() is used to show output on the screen.

ðŸ”¹ Type Checking
type() is used to check the data type of a variable.

ðŸ”¹ Comments
Comments (#) are used to explain code. They are ignored by Python when running the program.

ðŸ”¹ Simple Programs (Assignments)
Multiplication of two numbers

Area of a square = side Ã— side

Average of two float numbers = (a + b) / 2

Comparison: Check if a >= b returns True or False
