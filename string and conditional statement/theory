🔁 Conditional Statements (Decision Making in Python)
If Statement

If-Else Statement
If the condition is true, one block runs; else another block runs.

If-Elif-Else Ladder
Multiple conditions checked one by one until one is true.

Nested If Statements
One if-statement inside another. Used for checking multiple levels of conditions.

Assignment 3: Even or Odd
Checks if a number is divisible by 2 (even) or not (odd).

Assignment 4: Greatest of 3 Numbers
Compares three numbers and finds which one is the largest.

Assignment 5: Multiple of 7
