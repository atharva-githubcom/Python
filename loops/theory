üîÅ Looping in Python
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met or over a sequence (like list, tuple, etc.).

1. while Loop
A while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is True.

It checks the condition before each iteration.

If the condition becomes False, the loop stops.

Key uses:
Repeating a task a specific number of times (using a counter).

Traversing lists or tuples when index-based access is required.

Useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

2. Examples of while Loop Applications
Printing values repeatedly: You increment a counter until a limit is reached.

Reverse printing (100 to 1): Start from a higher value and decrement.

Multiplication tables: Multiply the number with increasing values.

Iterating over lists/tuples: Use an index and check it against length.

Searching for a value: Compare each element with the target.

3. for Loop
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like list, tuple, string, or a range of numbers).

It automatically picks each element one by one.

Key uses:
Looping over lists, tuples, strings.

Using the range() function to generate a series of numbers for iteration.

Known as a count-controlled loop.

4. Examples of for Loop Applications
Print elements of a list: Loops through each item directly.

Search in a list: Use conditional if to match a value.

Using range(start, stop, step): Create number sequences easily.

range(5) gives 0 to 4.

range(1, 5) gives 1 to 4.

range(1, 5, 2) gives 1, 3.

Even numbers: Check i % 2 == 0.

Reverse loop: Use a negative step, like range(100, 0, -1).

Sum of numbers: Accumulate using a variable.

Table of a number: Multiply the fixed number with loop index.

5. Key Concepts Highlighted
Concept	Explanation
while loop	Conditional loop (runs as long as the condition is true)
for loop	Sequence-based loop
break	Exits the loop when condition is met
else with loop	Runs when loop completes without a break
range() function	Generates a sequence of numbers
Looping over list/tuple	Iterates through each element
Searching in a collection	Checks if a specific value exists
Table & sum	Use arithmetic inside the loop
